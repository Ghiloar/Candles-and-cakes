# cake-candles
A python version of the simulation of the 2 candles 1 cake problem (for more info see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkVe8qrT0LA).
The problem is the following: on a linear cake with 2 candles placed at random positions what is the probability that, after cutting the cake at a random position there will be exactly 1 candle on one slice and 1 candle on the other? What about a circular cake?
